- 👋 Hi, I’m @PainChungles
- 👀 I’m interested in coding for Friday Night Funkin mods
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haxe and HaxeFlixel currently
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Friday Night Funkin mod honestly, I always wanted to see if my skills could help
- Where I currently am I'd say I'm pretty good at doing Lua stuff on psych engine, I've been trying to learn Haxe but I'm still a total noob at the moment, but I'm working hard
- 📫 How to reach me ... Does github have a DM feature?
